# Contributing to gwi

Thanks for your interest. gwi is in its early extraction phase, so the best way to help right
now is to comment on the design in
[rust-works/omni-dev#2203](https://github.com/rust-works/omni-dev/issues/2203).

## Workflow

1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused. Run `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
   and `cargo test`.
3. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/); see
   [.omni-dev/commit-guidelines.md](.omni-dev/commit-guidelines.md) and
   [docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md](docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md).
4. Add a bullet under `[Unreleased]` in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
5. Open a pull request. It merges by rebase through a merge queue.
